# EPIC project

## Running project

Just open it with android studio and run the app module

Tested on Pixel 5 - API 33 emulator.

## Architecture

Simple MVI architecture that should have more iterations to finish it.

## Considerations

This is the first iteration of the project

Project should work as described in the document

Only one UI test as example

Unit tests done as a black box on ViewModels, mocking server access, and database.

Performance has not been addressed

Also there are a lot of things that should be improved in next iterations.
